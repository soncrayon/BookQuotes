## BookQuotes
---

BookQuotes is an app that lets you document and store your favorite quotes from that latest good read.  It is built using a Rails API with some vanilla JavaScript (and of course some HTML and CSS) making up the frontend.

I created this application for the required JavaScript end-of-module project in the Flatiron School Online Web Immersive Program.  My approach was to build something simple and clear where I could apply what I was learning about using Rails as an API and JavaScript to both manipulate the DOM and make AJAX calls to that API.  

### Getting Up and Running
---

Fork and clone the repository to your local machine.  Please make sure you have the latest version of Rails installed. I used Rails 5.2.3 for development.  

In your terminal, navigate to the "backend" directory and execute "rails s" to start the server. 

Then, navigate to the "frontend" directory (or simply expand if using a code editor) and open book_quotes.html.  

### Interacting with the Application
---

Once the app is open, you can scroll to browse the book quotes already included in the database.  You have the option to delete any book quote.  Before deleting, you will prompted to confirm that you're sure.  

You can also create new book quotes by simply clicking the button on the left. This will open a form modal where you can input the required information to create the quote.  After you're done, hit submit and your quote will be added to the end of the list.
